# DinoRunReinforcementLearning
Made for Data Structures class at Loyola University Chicago. Original PyGame designed by https://github.com/rohitravirane. I stripped down several elements and added a Reinforcement Learning model which can eventually play the game indefinitely. 

Run the game from main (must have PyGame module) and the game will play itself.
